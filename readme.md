## Usage
This version has the CSS files included, no need to run npm

## Implementation

WatchAndCode.com has a great practical javascript course. Once you finished it(at least, what is has now, it'll keep growing), you should definitly check out the premium section. It will take you thru the jQuery version of TodoMVC and tech you how to read the code in existing apps.
This TodoMVC version I created was for practice for what I've learned so far in the free practical javascript course and the premium course of Watch And Code.
